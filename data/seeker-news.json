      "content": "Those betting against SOL are currently paying an annual rate of 20% just to keep their short positions open, a rare and aggressive move. When funding rates remain negative for over a week, it shows bears have strong conviction. In contrast, ETH\u2019s annualized funding rate sat at 1% on Wednesday. While that\u2019s below the usual 6% neutral mark, it\u2019s nowhere near the lopsided levels seen in SOL.

These arrangements help maintain an accessible platform and do not result in additional costs to readers. This price slump is also hurting the decentralized applications (DApps) built on Solana. Revenues are down across the board, from staking and decentralized exchanges to launchpads and lending platforms. Investors are starting to worry about a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d in which falling prices reduce incentives, making it harder for people to justify holding SOL for the long haul. Weekly DApp revenue on Solana dropped to $22.8 million, the lowest since October 2024. Notably, the memecoin launchpad Pump generated $9.1 million in revenue over those seven days, accounting for 40% of the network's total revenue. In comparison, weekly DApps revenue on Ethereum totaled $16 million, up 2% from the previous month. Even though SOL remains among the top seven cryptocurrencies by market cap, the 67% slide from its $253 peak in September 2025 has left a mark on both onchain activity and derivatives. In fact, SOL futures open interest has dropped 75% from its $13.5 billion high seen only five months ago.",

The integration between Anchorage Digital, Kamino and Solana Company underscores growing institutional interest in decentralized finance. However, that momentum is unfolding against an uncertain regulatory backdrop in the United States, where lawmakers are still debating how to oversee digital assets and DeFi platforms. Anchorage acts as collateral manager, overseeing loan-to-value ratios, margin requirements and, if necessary, liquidations. Because the collateral remains in segregated custody, institutions do not need to move assets into smart contracts, a requirement that has historically limited participation by regulated entities. Anchorage Digital has partnered with Kamino and Solana Company to roll out a structure that allows institutions to borrow against staked Solana without moving assets out of regulated custody, potentially addressing a key friction between traditional finance and decentralized lending markets. Industry groups have raised concerns that earlier draft language, including amendments introduced in January, does not sufficiently distinguish between centralized intermediaries and decentralized systems.",

Sellers will again attempt to halt the recovery at the 20-day EMA, but if the buyers pierce the resistance, the pair may run toward the 50-day SMA ($464).\u00a0 The DOGE/USDT pair might drop to the $0.08 level, which is likely to attract buyers. If the Dogecoin price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bearish momentum is weakening. The pair may then jump toward the breakdown level of $0.12.",

Historically, SOL's price plunged near or even below the lowest MVRV band before a significant rally took place. This can be seen in March 2022, when SOL price rose 87% within three weeks to $140 after testing the lowest MVRV deviation band around $75. A similar rebound occurred earlier in June 2022 and December 2020. The two-day chart shows that the price had broken below the H&amp;S\u2019s neckline at $120 on Jan. 30. The measured target of the H&amp;S pattern, calculated by adding the head\u2019s height from the breakdown point, is $57, representing a 30% drop from the current level. Below $80, SOL's first line of defense is provided by the lowest boundary of its MVRV pricing bands at $73. The bands represent onchain price zones that show when SOL is trading below or above the average price at which traders last moved their coins.

That matters for issuers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), asset managers and other institutional clients, who often prefer custodians with national oversight, which can streamline compliance and operational processes. While Crypto.com already runs a qualified custodian, Crypto.com Custody Trust Co., regulated by New Hampshire\u2019s banking department, the OCC charter brings its institutional offerings under a single federal framework. Austria&#x27;s financial regulator said KuCoin EU must appoint an anti-money-laundering officer and deputy officer, as well as a sanctions compliance officer and deputy.  The national charter offers that one-stop-shop structure, though only for trust services, not for traditional banking.",

      "content": "Solana\u2019s recent exchange netflow is another factor worth observing. Toward the end of 2025 and into early 2026, inflows exceeded outflows, suggesting that investors were moving funds from self-custody to centralized platforms. This shift is considered a bearish signal because it can be interpreted as a pre-sale step. In recent weeks, however, the trend has reversed with outflows surpassing inflows. The technical analysis tool gauges the speed and magnitude of recent price movements, offering insight into whether a potential trend reversal may be developing. It ranges from 0 to 100, and ratios below 30 indicate that SOL is oversold and could be on the verge of a rally. Data shows that the RSI has dipped well below that zone on a weekly scale. Dimitar got interested in cryptocurrencies back in 2018 amid the prolonged bear market. His biggest passion in the field is Bitcoin and he was fascinated with its journey. With a flair for producing high-quality content, he started covering the cryptocurrency space in late 2018. His hobby is football. Moreover, Martinez warned investors to pay close attention to the $76 support zone. He believes that breaking below it could open the door to a further pullback to $53, $35, and $23. Despite the broader crypto market\u2019s depressed condition and SOL\u2019s substantial correction, the asset\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a rebound could be on the way.",

The pivot also represents an attempt by miners to be valued less as leveraged bitcoin proxies and more as digital infrastructure and AI plays. Bitdeer (BTDR) a Singapore-based bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure company has reduced its bitcoin treasury stash to zero, marking a sharp break from the  miner playbook of hoarding coins as a signal of conviction seen by the likes of Strategy (MSTR).  Bitdeer is accelerating its push into AI infrastructure, rolling out NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems in Malaysia and advancing conversions of several sites in the U.S. and Europe from crypto mining to AI data centers.  AI expansion is far more capital intensive than incremental mining buildouts, requiring large scale GPU clusters and data center upgrades.

      "content": "ChatGPT agreed to an extent, but warned that most of the highly anticipated bullish catalysts from the past few years, such as the SEC lawsuit resolution and the approval of spot XRP ETFs, are already behind the token, so it might be in search of new ones. As such, it was rather conservative in predicting a target for the summer, putting a base case around the $2.40 range. Nevertheless, ChatGPT and Perplexity agreed that several factors have aligned to suggest that XRP\u2019s bottom might be rather close \u2013 a 50% month decline from January 6 to February 6 was met with immediate buying pressure, funding rates reached deeply negative levels, a development that preceded rallies in the past, and panic selling appears to have subsided. Gemini and Grok were somewhat optimistic that XRP could indeed locate a bottom by spring 2026, which would open the door for the next phase \u2013 \u201cbase building and recovery.\u201d In this neutral-to-cautiously bullish stage, XRP could regain some traction by the beginning of the summer season. Ripple\u2019s cross-border token has been highly volatile since the US presidential elections in late 2024. At the time, it traded at $0.60, exploded to its 2018 all-time high of $3.40 in January 2025, plunged in the following months, before it skyrocketed to a new record of $3.65 in July. Before even having a theoretical chance of reversing its trend, XRP would need to bottom out first. OpenAI\u2019s platform noted that the token is currently searching for it, which could happen by April, but before it does, it could face even harsher declines if history is any indication:",

Since February 13, large holders have moved approximately 900,000 BTC, valued at $60 billion. This transfer activity suggests that significant capital may be preparing to exit positions following limited price appreciation. Bitcoin is trading at $66,188 at the time of writing after slipping below the $67,394 support level. The asset remains confined between $65,000 and $70,000. This consolidation range reflects ongoing equilibrium. A decisive breakout or breakdown will likely define the next major move in Bitcoin price. On-chain data indicates that younger holders are choosing to HODL rather than exit positions. HODL waves show that the supply held by investors aged one to three months has declined by 5%. This supply has matured into the three- to six-month cohort, signaling reduced short-term selling. Currently, Bitcoin remains rangebound, reflecting balanced pressure between buyers and sellers. This equilibrium suggests that investor behavior from here will likely determine the next directional move. Insights, news and analysis of the crypto market straight to your inbox",
