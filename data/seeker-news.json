      "teaser": "A drop in Solana\u2019s DApp revenue, along with limited institutional and retail investor interest, adds vulnerability to SOL\u2019s $78 support.",
      "content": "Those betting against SOL are currently paying an annual rate of 20% just to keep their short positions open, a rare and aggressive move. When funding rates remain negative for over a week, it shows bears have strong conviction. In contrast, ETH\u2019s annualized funding rate sat at 1% on Wednesday. While that\u2019s below the usual 6% neutral mark, it\u2019s nowhere near the lopsided levels seen in SOL.

These arrangements help maintain an accessible platform and do not result in additional costs to readers. This price slump is also hurting the decentralized applications (DApps) built on Solana. Revenues are down across the board, from staking and decentralized exchanges to launchpads and lending platforms. Investors are starting to worry about a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d in which falling prices reduce incentives, making it harder for people to justify holding SOL for the long haul. Weekly DApp revenue on Solana dropped to $22.8 million, the lowest since October 2024. Notably, the memecoin launchpad Pump generated $9.1 million in revenue over those seven days, accounting for 40% of the network's total revenue. In comparison, weekly DApps revenue on Ethereum totaled $16 million, up 2% from the previous month. Even though SOL remains among the top seven cryptocurrencies by market cap, the 67% slide from its $253 peak in September 2025 has left a mark on both onchain activity and derivatives. In fact, SOL futures open interest has dropped 75% from its $13.5 billion high seen only five months ago.",

      "content": "Polymarket is a blockchain-based prediction platform where users trade contracts on real-world outcomes using real money. The odds tend to reflect genuine conviction because bettors risk capital rather than just opinions. The platform gained mainstream credibility during the 2024 U.S. election cycle and has since become crypto&#x27;s de facto sentiment gauge for unresolved events. As of Asian morning hours Tuesday, Meteora is the heavy favorite at 43%, with $319,000 in volume on that outcome alone. The Solana-based liquidity layer has been a recurring name in community discussions around meme coin market structure \u2014 particularly around how launch liquidity gets seeded and who ends up on the right side of early price moves.  The odds have shifted notably since the market opened. Axiom, Pump.fun, and Jupiter have all fallen 37-42% from their initial readings, while Meteora has consolidated its lead \u2014 a pattern that suggests early speculation has given way to more directional conviction as bettors parse ZachXBT&#x27;s prior work and posting patterns for clues. Axiom sits at 13%, followed by Pump.fun at 12% with the highest single-outcome volume at $332,000 \u2014 suggesting heavy two-way action rather than consensus. Pump.fun&#x27;s inclusion tracks with months of scrutiny over early-wallet sniping on the platform, though the project has denied allegations of insider advantages. Jupiter rounds out at 8% and MEXC at 7%. Jupiter&#x27;s presence reflects broader questions about Solana DeFi routing and fee extraction, while MEXC has faced persistent social media chatter about listing behavior and whale-friendly timing on meme coin markets.",

The integration between Anchorage Digital, Kamino and Solana Company underscores growing institutional interest in decentralized finance. However, that momentum is unfolding against an uncertain regulatory backdrop in the United States, where lawmakers are still debating how to oversee digital assets and DeFi platforms. Anchorage acts as collateral manager, overseeing loan-to-value ratios, margin requirements and, if necessary, liquidations. Because the collateral remains in segregated custody, institutions do not need to move assets into smart contracts, a requirement that has historically limited participation by regulated entities. Anchorage Digital has partnered with Kamino and Solana Company to roll out a structure that allows institutions to borrow against staked Solana without moving assets out of regulated custody, potentially addressing a key friction between traditional finance and decentralized lending markets. Industry groups have raised concerns that earlier draft language, including amendments introduced in January, does not sufficiently distinguish between centralized intermediaries and decentralized systems.",

      "content": "FxPro chief market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in an email bitcoin&#x27;s recent attempt at recovery is shaping up as consolidation rather than reversal. He pointed to a bearish pennant forming on the daily chart, noting that a move below the mid-$65,000 area would confirm downside continuation while a break above $70,000 would invalidate the pattern.  That kind of broad risk recalibration tends to hit crypto on a lag. Digital assets don&#x27;t always sell off in lockstep with equities, but they are sensitive to the same shifts in liquidity and positioning that drive risk-off moves \u2014 and right now, the mood in both markets is pointing the same direction. Altcoins are faring worse. Ethereum traded near $1,829, down 8% on the week. XRP fell 10.8%, Solana&#x27;s SOL shed 11.3%, and dogecoin dropped nearly 10%. The underperformance across majors reflects a market where risk appetite is shrinking toward bitcoin and even that bid is thinning. More broadly, he described the $60,000-to-$70,000 range as historically significant \u2014 a zone that acted as the ceiling for the entire 2021 cycle and now appears to be serving as a battlefield between long-term accumulators and newer holders cutting losses. Bitcoin is now 48% below its October all-time high and sitting 5.5% below its 2021 peak of $69,000. The longer it trades in this range without reclaiming higher ground, the more the technical picture tilts toward the bears.",

A graduate in Political Science and Journalism, her interest lies in regulatory implications with a focus on technological evolution in the crypto realm. Market participation has thinned significantly, as ETP trading slid to $17 billion, the weakest level since July 2025, amidst signs of disengagement among institutions and retail allocators alike globally this quarter.

However, the relative strength index (RSI) is in oversold territory, indicating that a relief rally is possible in the near term. If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will attempt to push the BNB/USDT pair above the $669 level. If they can pull it off, the pair may march toward the 20-day EMA ($710). If the price turns down from the current level or the $2,111 resistance, it suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the level. The Ether price may then retest the critical support at $1,750. If the level cracks, the ETH/USDT pair may extend the decline to the next major support at $1,537. That increases the likelihood of a break above $360. If that happens, the bears will again try to halt the recovery at the 20-day EMA ($385). However, buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pierce the 20-day EMA, clearing the path for a rally toward the 50-day SMA ($460). The SOL/USDT pair may reach the breakdown level of $95, where the bears are expected to pose a strong challenge. If the price turns down sharply from the $95 level, it suggests that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. The Solana price may then plummet to the $67 level.",

To support open access to our website and sustain editorial operations, certain commercial or partner references may appear on our site. These arrangements help maintain an accessible platform and do not result in additional costs to readers. Historically, SOL's price plunged near or even below the lowest MVRV band before a significant rally took place. This can be seen in March 2022, when SOL price rose 87% within three weeks to $140 after testing the lowest MVRV deviation band around $75. A similar rebound occurred earlier in June 2022 and December 2020. The two-day chart shows that the price had broken below the H&amp;S\u2019s neckline at $120 on Jan. 30. The measured target of the H&amp;S pattern, calculated by adding the head\u2019s height from the breakdown point, is $57, representing a 30% drop from the current level. Below $80, SOL's first line of defense is provided by the lowest boundary of its MVRV pricing bands at $73. The bands represent onchain price zones that show when SOL is trading below or above the average price at which traders last moved their coins.

Toward the end of 2025 and into early 2026, inflows exceeded outflows, suggesting that investors were moving funds from self-custody to centralized platforms. This shift is considered a bearish signal because it can be interpreted as a pre-sale step. In recent weeks, however, the trend has reversed with outflows surpassing inflows. The technical analysis tool gauges the speed and magnitude of recent price movements, offering insight into whether a potential trend reversal may be developing. It ranges from 0 to 100, and ratios below 30 indicate that SOL is oversold and could be on the verge of a rally. Data shows that the RSI has dipped well below that zone on a weekly scale.

With a flair for producing high-quality content, he started covering the cryptocurrency space in late 2018. His hobby is football. Moreover, Martinez warned investors to pay close attention to the $76 support zone. He believes that breaking below it could open the door to a further pullback to $53, $35, and $23. Despite the broader crypto market\u2019s depressed condition and SOL\u2019s substantial correction, the asset\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a rebound could be on the way.",
