Others charge 15%. That single number could mean hundreds of dollars in lost rewards over a year. Here's exactly how commission works — and why you shouldn't always chase the lowest rate.  <p>  <h3>What Is Validator Commission?  <p>  When you stake SOL, your validator earns rewards from processing transactions. The validator doesn't keep everything. Commission is their cut.  <p>  Here's a simple example. You stake 1,000 SOL. The network awards 7% APY in rewards. That's 70 SOL in a year. If your validator charges 10% commission, they keep 7 SOL. You receive 63 SOL.  <p>  The validator sets their commission rate themselves. They can raise or lower it over time. Some validators keep the same rate for years. Others adjust based on costs or competition.  <p>  Commission is different from your stake. The validator's SOL stake (their own money) is separate from the SOL delegated to them. Commission is a percentage of rewards, not a percentage of stake.  <p>  Commission rates are visible on-chain. You can check any validator's current rate using block explorers. There's no secret fee.  <p>  <h3>The Commission Spectrum  <p>  Validator commission rates fall into clear categories.  <p>  <strong>0% Commission</strong>  <p>  These validators take nothing from your rewards. Sounds perfect, right? But how do they pay for servers, bandwidth, and expertise?  <p>  Some 0% validators are new and building their delegator base. They might raise rates once they have enough stake. Others might be subsidized by other businesses. Some simply can't sustain operations long-term.  <p>  Be very skeptical of 0%. It's usually not sustainable. If you see one, check their infrastructure quality and track record carefully.  <p>  <strong>1-5% Commission</strong>  <p>  Low commission rates are attractive but rare. Validators at this level might have different business models. Maybe they're large operations where volume makes up for low rates. Maybe they're building market share.  <p>  At these rates, a validator needs significant delegated stake to cover costs. 1-5% can work for established validators with substantial delegations.  <p>  <strong>6-10% Commission</strong>  <p>  This is the healthy range. Most quality validators fall here. 8% is particularly common.  <p>  At these rates, validators can cover infrastructure costs, make a reasonable profit, and maintain quality operations. If a validator has good uptime and transparent infrastructure, 6-10% is fair.  <p>  <strong>11-15% Commission</strong>  <p>  Higher commission rates are less common. Some validators charge this much because they offer premium services. Maybe they have 24/7 support, exceptional uptime, or specialized infrastructure.  <p>  Or maybe they're just expensive. There's no guarantee higher commission means better service.  <p>  <h3>Why 0% Should Raise Red Flags  <p>  Let's be direct: 0% commission is usually a warning sign.  <p>  <strong>Infrastructure costs money.</strong> Quality data centers, hardware, bandwidth, and expertise aren't free. A validator spending $10,000/year on operations needs substantial delegated stake to break even. At 0%, they'd need millions in delegations.  <p>  <strong>The honeymoon period.</strong> Some validators offer 0% to attract delegators. Once they build a large stake base, they raise commission. You might get a good deal briefly, then face higher rates or must switch validators.  <p>  <strong>Subsidies have limits.</strong> If a validator is subsidized by another business, that subsidy might end. The validator could become unsustainable.  <p>  <strong>Track record matters.</strong> A new validator with 0% commission hasn't proven themselves. They might be amateurs who will make costly mistakes.  <p>  There's an exception: legitimate small validators who charge 1-3% and are transparent about costs. But be cautious. Always evaluate the whole picture.  <p>  <h3>Finding the Commission Sweet Spot  <p>  The healthy commission range is 7-10%. Here's why.  <p>  At 7-10%, validators can run sustainable operations. They cover hosting, bandwidth, hardware, and make a profit. They have incentive to maintain good uptime and service.  <p>  What do you get for paying more? It depends on the validator.  <p>  <strong>Infrastructure quality.</strong> Higher commission might mean redundant systems, professional data centers, and fast network connections.  <p>  <strong>Support responsiveness.</strong> Some validators offer customer support. If you have questions or problems, they respond quickly.  <p>  <strong>Transparency.</strong> Quality validators often publish detailed infrastructure information. They run active communities and communicate regularly.  <p>  <strong>Consistency.</strong> Lower-cost validators might cut corners. Higher rates might mean better reliability.  <p>  The lowest commission isn't always the best deal. Focus on the whole package: uptime, infrastructure, commission, and community.  <p>  <h3>Impact on Your Staking Returns  <p>  Commission directly affects your bottom line. Let's calculate.  <p>  Say you stake $10,000 worth of SOL (about 100 SOL at $100 each). The network rewards 7% APY.  <p>  <strong>At 5% commission:</strong> 7% × 0.95 = 6.65% APY → $665/year <strong>At 8% commission:</strong> 7% × 0.92 = 6.44% APY → $644/year <strong>At 10% commission:</strong> 7% × 0.90 = 6.30% APY → $630/year  <p>  The difference between 5% and 10% is $35/year on a $10,000 stake. Over five years, that's $175 lost to higher commission.  <p>  Small differences compound. The bigger your stake, the more commission matters.  <p>  But don't optimize commission alone. A validator at 5% commission with poor uptime might cost you more than one at 8% with excellent reliability.  <p>  <h3>Practical Advice  <p>  Here's how to think about commission.  <p>  <strong>Use 7-10% as your range.</strong> This covers most quality validators.  <p>  <strong>Don't automatically pick the lowest.</strong> Look at uptime, infrastructure, and community first.  <p>  <strong>Check for rate changes.</strong> Has the validator raised commission recently? If so, why?  <p>  <strong>Consider total returns.</strong> A validator with 8% commission but slightly lower uptime might be worse than one with 10% and perfect uptime.  <p>  <strong>Evaluate sustainability.</strong> A validator barely covering costs might disappear. A sustainable business is better for long-term stakers.  <p>  <strong>Next step:</strong> Compare validator commission rates at [validator.com](/).  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>FAQ  <p>  <h4>What is a good validator commission rate?  <p>  7-10% is the healthy range. Below 5% may be unsustainable. Above 12% is expensive without clear justification.  <p>  <h4>Can validators change their commission?  <p>  Yes. Validators can adjust their commission rate. Check for recent changes. Some validators keep the same rate for years.  <p>  <h4>Why do some validators charge 0%?  <p>  Some use 0% to attract delegators (honeymoon period). Others may be subsidized. Be skeptical of sustainability.  <p>  <h4>Does higher commission mean better service?  <p>  Not necessarily. Some premium validators charge more, but others charge high rates without better service. Evaluate holistically.  <p>  <h4>How is validator commission calculated?  <p>  Commission is a percentage of staking rewards. If network rewards 7% and commission is 10%, you receive 6.3% after the validator's cut.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Key Takeaways  <p>  - Validator commission ranges from 0-15% on Solana - The industry standard is 7-10% for sustainable operations - 0% commission validators may not be sustainable long-term - Commission directly impacts your staking APY - Higher commission can mean better uptime and support - Focus on overall value, not just the commission number - Check for commission rate changes over time - Evaluate infrastructure quality alongside commission
