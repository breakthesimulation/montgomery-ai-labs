    --- created: 2026-02-22 01:45 UTC from: Quill tags:   - quill   - validator-com   - staking   - guide status: draft note: Full article - How to Choose a Validator ---  <p>  <h2>How to Choose a Validator — The Staker's Framework  <p>  You're about to stake your hard-earned SOL. But there are 1,800+ validators. Picking wrong could cost you money — or worse, expose you to centralized risk. Here's how to separate the signal from the noise.  <p>  <h3>The Five Criteria Framework  <p>  Not all validators are equal. Use these five criteria to evaluate any validator.  <p>  <strong>1. Uptime</strong>  <p>  Uptime measures how often the validator is working. Look for 99.9%+ uptime over the past few epochs. A validator at 99% sounds good, but that means 3.5 days of downtime per year. That's real money lost.  <p>  Check both recent uptime and historical performance. Some validators had problems in the past. If they've recovered, that's okay. But if they've been flaky recently, avoid them.  <p>  <strong>2. Commission</strong>  <p>  Validator commission is their cut of the staking rewards. A validator charging 10% gives you 90% of the rewards. One charging 5% gives you 95%.  <p>  The sweet spot is 7-10%. Rates below 5% may be unsustainable. Rates above 12% are expensive. But a high-commission validator with excellent infrastructure might be worth it.  <p>  <strong>3. Stake Concentration</strong>  <p>  This is crucial for decentralization. If one validator holds too much SOL, they have too much power. Look at how much total SOL is staked with them.  <p>  Validators with over 5% of total stake are concerning. The top 10 validators combined shouldn't control more than 25-30% of stake. When you stake, you're supporting decentralization.  <p>  <strong>4. Infrastructure</strong>  <p>  How does the validator run their node? Quality infrastructure means better uptime and security.  <p>  Look for information about their data center, hardware, and redundancy. Professional validators publish this info. If they don't share anything, that's a red flag.  <p>  Good validators have backups, monitoring, and fast network connections. They respond quickly when problems occur.  <p>  <strong>5. Community</strong>  <p>  Active Discord servers, transparent communication, and helpful responses all matter. Good validators engage with their stakers.  <p>  Check if they respond to questions. See if they post updates about their operations. Community trust takes time to build.  <p>  <h3>Understanding Validator Metrics  <p>  Now that you know what to look for, let's decode the actual numbers.  <p>  <strong>APY Calculation</strong>  <p>  Staking APY on Solana runs around 6-8%. Your actual return depends on the validator's commission. If the network pays 7% and validator charges 8% commission, you get:  <p>  7% × (1 - 0.08) = 6.44%  <p>  Some wallets show "effective APY" after commission. This helps compare validators directly.  <p>  <strong>What "Delinquent" Means</strong>  <p>  If a validator misses too many votes, they become "delinquent." This means they're not doing their job. A delinquent validator won't earn rewards, and neither will you.  <p>  Always check the delinquent status. It's usually red and obvious in any validator explorer.  <p>  <strong>Why Stake Concentration Matters</strong>  <p>  Decentralization isn't just a buzzword. If a few validators control most of the stake, they could potentially censor transactions or influence the network.  <p>  When you stake with an already-dominant validator, you're making concentration worse. Choose smaller validators to help balance the network.  <p>  <h3>Red Flags to Avoid  <p>  Watch out for these warning signs.  <p>  <strong>0% Commission</strong>  <p>  Some validators charge 0%. This sounds great. But how do they pay for infrastructure? Either they're losing money (unsustainable) or there's a catch.  <p>  Be skeptical of 0%. A small commission (5-8%) is more realistic for a sustainable operation.  <p>  <strong>Single Data Center</strong>  <p>  If a validator doesn't disclose their infrastructure, that's a problem. Even worse: if all their nodes are in one building. Hardware fails. Networks go down. Redundancy matters.  <p>  <strong>No Public Information</strong>  <p>  Validators who don't share their setup are harder to trust. Professional operations publish details about their data centers and hardware.  <p>  <strong>History of Downtime</strong>  <p>  Check for past incidents. A validator might have had a rough start but recovered. Or they might have ongoing problems. Look at the last 30-90 days of performance.  <p>  <strong>Slash History</strong>  <p>  If a validator has been slashed before, find out why. Slashing means they broke protocol rules and lost staked SOL. A single incident might be explainable. Multiple incidents suggest incompetence.  <p>  <h3>Building a Diversified Validator Set  <p>  Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Here's why diversification matters.  <p>  <strong>Validator Failure</strong>  <p>  Things go wrong. Validators go offline. Sometimes they close entirely. If all your SOL is with one validator, you're stuck waiting for unbonding.  <p>  By spreading across 3-5 validators, you reduce your exposure to any single point of failure.  <p>  <strong>Decentralization Support</strong>  <p>  Your staking choices affect the network. Staking with smaller validators helps decentralization. Staking with the biggest validators makes them bigger.  <p>  This isn't just philosophical. A decentralized network is more secure and resilient.  <p>  <strong>Recommended Approach</strong>  <p>  Stake with 3-5 validators. Include some with lower commission (5-7%), some with average (7-10%). Mix larger established validators with smaller ones.  <p>  Rebalance occasionally. If a validator's performance drops, move your stake. This keeps your returns healthy.  <p>  <h3>Tools for Validator Research  <p>  You don't need to do this manually. Several tools make validator research easy.  <p>  <strong>Solana Beach</strong> (solanabeach.io) shows detailed validator stats. You can sort by uptime, commission, stake size, and more. It's the most comprehensive tool.  <p>  <strong>SolanaFM</strong> (solana.fm) offers similar data with a cleaner interface. Good for quick checks.  <p>  <strong>Staking rewards calculators</strong> help estimate your returns. Multiply your stake by the effective APY to see expected earnings.  <p>  Many wallets let you compare validators directly. Phantom, Solflare, and Ledger all integrate with the network and show key metrics.  <p>  <h3>Your Next Step  <p>  Ready to stake smarter? Visit [validator.com](/) to find validators matching these criteria. Look for 99.9%+ uptime, 7-10% commission, reasonable stake concentration, and transparent infrastructure.  <p>  Remember: your validator choice affects both your returns and the network's health. Choose wisely.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>FAQ  <p>  <h4>What is the best Solana validator?  <p>  The best validator depends on your priorities. Look for 99.9%+ uptime, 7-10% commission, and reasonable stake size. The "best" varies by your needs.  <p>  <h4>How do I check validator uptime?  <p>  Use Solana Beach or SolanaFM. Look for 99.9%+ uptime over recent epochs. Check both current and historical performance.  <p>  <h4>Should I choose low commission validators?  <p>  Not necessarily. Very low commission (0-3%) may be unsustainable. 7-10% is the healthy range. Focus on uptime and infrastructure quality.  <p>  <h4>What is validator commission?  <p>  Commission is the validator's cut of staking rewards. If a validator charges 10% commission, they keep 10% and you receive 90%.  <p>  <h4>How many validators should I stake with?  <p>  Stake with 3-5 validators. This provides diversification and supports decentralization.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Key Takeaways  <p>  - Evaluate validators on uptime, commission, stake concentration, infrastructure, and community - Avoid putting all your stake with one validator - 0% commission validators may not be sustainable - Diversification protects against validator failure - Use tools like Solana Beach to research performance - Look for 99.9%+ uptime as your baseline - Support decentralization by choosing smaller validators
