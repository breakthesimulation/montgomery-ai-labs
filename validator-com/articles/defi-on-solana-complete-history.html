  <time class="date" datetime="2026-02-20">Published: 2026-02-20</time>
  <div class="article-content">--- created: 2026-02-20 09:40 UTC from: Quill tags:   - quill   - validator-com   - solana   - defi   - history status: draft note: DeFi on Solana complete history — validator.com article ---  <p>  <h2>DeFi on Solana: The Complete History  <p>  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Solana's DeFi ecosystem has experienced one of crypto's most dramatic narratives—from a $10+ billion TVL boom in 2021, through a devastating collapse to $210 million post-FTX, to a remarkable recovery surpassing $11 billion by late 2025. This is the complete story of how Solana built a distinctive DeFi stack that differs fundamentally from Ethereum's approach.  <p>  <h3>Introduction  <p>  When Solana launched in 2020, few predicted it would become home to one of crypto's most vibrant decentralized finance ecosystems. Yet by late 2021, Solana DeFi protocols were handling billions in daily trading volume, competing head-to-head with Ethereum for market share. Then came the FTX collapse in November 2022, which devastated the ecosystem and left many questioning Solana's future.  <p>  Today, Solana stands as a DeFi powerhouse, with six protocols surpassing $1 billion in TVL and the network processing more daily DEX volume than Ethereum [1]. Understanding this history reveals not just what happened, but why Solana's DeFi ecosystem developed so differently from other chains—and what makes it unique.  <p>  <h3>The Foundation: Serum and the FTX Connection  <p>  <h4>Serum DEX: Sam Bankman-Fried's Vision  <p>  The story of Solana DeFi cannot be told without addressing its most controversial foundation: Serum. Launched in August 2020, Serum was a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Solana that aimed to match the speed and efficiency of centralized exchanges while maintaining decentralization [2].  <p>  <strong>Total value locked (TVL)</strong> refers to the total value of assets deposited in a DeFi protocol, serving as a key metric for ecosystem health and user trust.  <p>  The protocol was created by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, in collaboration with the Solana Foundation [3]. Serum represented an ambitious attempt to build a high-performance order book-based DEX on a fast blockchain—leveraging Solana's sub-second transaction finality to create what SBF called a "trustless" alternative to centralized trading [4].  <p>  Serum's architecture was distinctive: it combined an on-chain order book with automatic market maker (AMM) functionality, offering both professional trading features and liquidity provision. The SRM token tokenized the fee structure, creating an early DeFi primitive that attracted significant TVL.  <p>  However, the close relationship between Serum, FTX, and Alameda Research would prove problematic. When FTX collapsed in November 2022, Serum's governance was thrown into chaos. Developers scrambled to create a "fork" of Serum that would remove all ties to Alameda, recognizing that a protocol controlled by a collapsed entity posed existential risks [5].  <p>  <h4>The DEX Wars: Raydium, Orca, and Aldrin  <p>  While Serum dominated early Solana DeFi, other protocols emerged to compete for liquidity and users. This period (late 2020 through 2021) became known as the "DEX wars."  <p>  <strong>Raydium</strong> launched in early 2021 as an AMM that integrated directly with Serum's order book, combining concentrated liquidity with access to Serum's trading pairs [6]. This hybrid approach made Raydium a powerful competitor, and it quickly became one of Solana's leading DEXes. By late 2021, Raydium's TVL had surged past $2 billion during the bull market [7].  <p>  <strong>Orca</strong> positioned itself as a more user-friendly alternative, emphasizing intuitive design and fair token distribution. Launched in 2021, Orca's "whale" and "fair launch" approach attracted users who were wary of the FTX-connected ecosystem.  <p>  <strong>Aldrin</strong> (formerly Project Serum's AMM) represented another competitor in this crowded field, though it never achieved the same prominence as Raydium or Orca.  <p>  The DEX wars ultimately benefited users through competition, but they also fragmented liquidity across multiple protocols—a challenge Solana would later address through aggregators.  <p>  <h3>Marinade Finance and the Liquid Staking Revolution  <p>  One of Solana DeFi's most significant innovations came through <strong>Marinade Finance</strong>, which pioneered liquid staking on the network.  <p>  Before liquid staking, SOL holders who wanted to participate in staking had to lock their tokens and face a 2-3 day unbonding period. This created inefficiency—staked SOL couldn't be used in DeFi protocols while earning staking rewards.  <p>  Marinade Finance, launched in 2021, solved this through liquid staking derivatives. Users could stake SOL and receive mSOL tokens in return, representing their staked position plus accumulated rewards. mSOL could then be used in DeFi protocols—supplying liquidity, borrowing against it, or farming yields—while still earning staking rewards [8].  <p>  This innovation was transformative for Solana DeFi. It created a "stake-and-earn" model that significantly expanded the effective capital in the ecosystem. Marinade became one of the largest DeFi protocols on Solana by TVL, and its success inspired other liquid staking protocols including Jito (which also introduced MEV rewards) and BlazeStake.  <p>  <h3>The Rise and Fall: TVL from $0 to $10 Billion and Back  <p>  <h4>The 2021 Boom  <p>  Solana's DeFi TVL trajectory reflects the broader crypto market's extremes. In early 2021, total TVL across Solana DeFi protocols was negligible—a few hundred million dollars at most. By November 2021, during the peak of the crypto bull market, Solana DeFi had reached approximately <strong>$10-12 billion in TVL</strong> [9].  <p>  Several factors drove this explosive growth:  <p>  1. <strong>Solana's technical advantages</strong>: Sub-second finality and sub-cent transaction fees made DeFi usable for retail traders and small-scale users 2. <strong>Bull market momentum</strong>: Token prices surged, attracting capital 3. <strong>Yield farming incentives</strong>: Protocols distributed tokens to attract TVL 4. <strong>FTX/Alameda involvement</strong>: Significant capital from these entities supported liquidity  <p>  The ecosystem reached an inflection point where Solana was processing substantial DEX volume, competing directly with Ethereum.  <p>  <h4>The FTX Collapse: November 2022  <p>  On November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, triggering a cascade of failures across the Solana ecosystem. The impact on Solana DeFi was catastrophic:  <p>  - <strong>TVL plummeted</strong>: From approximately $10 billion at its peak, Solana DeFi TVL collapsed to around <strong>$210-364 million</strong> by early 2023—a decline exceeding 96% [10] - <strong>SOL price crashed</strong>: From approximately $260 in November 2021 to roughly $8-10 by December 2022 [11] - <strong>Confidence shattered</strong>: Many questioned whether Solana would survive  <p>  The collapse wasn't just about lost capital. The interconnectedness between Serum, FTX, Alameda, and much of the Solana ecosystem created systemic risk. Protocols that appeared decentralized were heavily reliant on entities that suddenly ceased operations.  <p>  <h4>Key historical TVL milestones:  <p>  | Period | TVL | Event | |--------|-----|-------| | November 2021 | ~$10-12B | Peak bull market | | December 2022 | ~$210-364M | Post-FTX trough | | Late 2023 | ~$655M | Early recovery | | October 2024 | ~$6.4B | New high since 2022 | | Late 2025 | ~$10-11B | Near all-time high |  <p>  <h3>Jupiter Aggregator: Becoming the DeFi Backbone  <p>  Perhaps no protocol better represents Solana DeFi's resilience than <strong>Jupiter</strong>. What began as a DEX aggregator became the ecosystem's central infrastructure.  <p>  <h4>The Rise During Crisis  <p>  Jupiter aggregated liquidity across multiple DEXs (Raydium, Orca, Serum, and others), finding users the best prices across the fragmented liquidity pools. This was particularly valuable during the post-FTX period when liquidity was scarce and fragmented.  <p>  Between December 2022 and May 2023—exactly the period following FTX's collapse—Jupiter processed <strong>$4 billion in cumulative trading volume</strong> [12]. This remarkable feat demonstrated that users still wanted to trade on Solana, even as the broader ecosystem faced collapse.  <p>  Jupiter's success stemmed from several factors:  <p>  1. <strong>Best price execution</strong>: Aggregating across DEXs ensured competitive pricing 2. <strong>Simplified UX</strong>: Users didn't need to understand which DEX had the best liquidity 3. <strong>Trust</strong>: Unlike Serum, Jupiter wasn't tied to FTX 4. <strong>Low costs</strong>: Solana's minimal fees made aggregation economically viable  <p>  <h4>Jupiter Today  <p>  By 2024-2025, Jupiter had evolved beyond simple aggregation. The platform added:  <p>  - <strong>Limit orders</strong>: Professional trading features - <strong>DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)</strong>: Automated recurring trades - <strong>Jupiter Lend</strong>: A lending protocol that became one of the fastest-growing in Solana history [13]  <p>  Jupiter's JUP token launched in 2024, further cementing its role as ecosystem infrastructure. As of late 2025, Jupiter remains one of Solana's dominant protocols, consistently ranking among the top by volume and TVL.  <p>  <h3>The Lending and Perps Era: Kamino, Drift, and MarginFi  <p>  As Solana DeFi recovered, a new frontier emerged: lending markets and perpetual futures. This era (2023-2025) saw the rise of protocols that differentiated Solana from simple DEX functionality.  <p>  <h4>Kamino Finance  <p>  <strong>Kamino Finance</strong> launched in 2022 as an automated liquidity and yield protocol, but truly emerged as a lending powerhouse in 2024-2025. The protocol enables users to lend and borrow crypto assets through transparent on-chain markets [14].  <p>  What makes Kamino distinctive is its "credit router" approach—deposits flow into automated vaults where users can earn yield while maintaining the ability to borrow against their collateral. This creates a seamless capital efficiency loop that appeals to both retail and institutional users.  <p>  By late 2025, Kamino had become the dominant lending protocol on Solana, with over <strong>$3.5 billion in TVL</strong> [15]. Its closest competitors—MarginFi and Solend—trailed significantly behind.  <p>  <h4>Drift Protocol  <p>  <strong>Drift Protocol</strong> focused on perpetual futures, enabling leveraged trading without the complexities of traditional exchanges. By early 2024, Drift commanded approximately <strong>57% of Solana's perps DEX volume</strong> [16].  <p>  Drift's success demonstrated that Solana could support sophisticated trading products beyond simple token swaps. The protocol's sub-second finality proved particularly valuable for perpetual trading, where execution speed directly impacts profitability.  <p>  <h4>MarginFi  <p>  <strong>MarginFi</strong> emerged as another major lending protocol, competing directly with Kamino and Solend. However, in April 2024, MarginFi experienced a leadership shakeup that sent users fleeing to competitors [17].  <p>  The MarginFi crisis demonstrated the importance of protocol governance and transparency. Kamino emerged as the primary beneficiary, absorbing much of the displaced capital.  <p>  <h3>Current State of Solana DeFi (2025-2026)  <p>  As of early 2026, Solana DeFi has achieved what seemed impossible in 2022: a complete recovery and then some.  <p>  <h4>TVL and Volume Milestones  <p>  - <strong>Total DeFi TVL</strong>: Approximately $10-11 billion, approaching all-time highs [18] - <strong>Six protocols have crossed $1 billion TVL</strong>: Jito, Kamino, Jupiter, Raydium, Marinade Finance, and Sanctum [19] - <strong>Daily DEX volume</strong>: Consistently exceeds $4-5 billion, often surpassing Ethereum [20] - <strong>Stablecoin supply</strong>: Approximately $12 billion on Solana  <p>  <h4>Key Protocols by Function  <p>  | Category | Leading Protocols | |----------|-------------------| | DEX/Aggregator | Jupiter, Raydium, Orca, Meteora | | Lending | Kamino, MarginFi, Solend, Jupiter Lend | | Liquid Staking | Marinade Finance, Jito, BlazeStake | | Perps/Trading | Drift, Mango Markets, Jupiter |  <p>  <h4>Why Solana DeFi Differs from Ethereum  <p>  Understanding why Solana developed differently from Ethereum (or any other chain) requires examining several factors:  <p>  1. <strong>Speed and cost</strong>: Solana's sub-second finality and sub-cent fees enable use cases impossible on Ethereum—high-frequency trading, small-scale transactions, and aggressive liquidation strategies 2. <strong>User experience</strong>: Lower costs mean simpler UX patterns—no complex gas optimization or Layer 2 navigation 3. <strong>Cultural identity</strong>: Post-FTX, Solana developers explicitly rejected the "VC-heavy" approaches common in other ecosystems, embracing open-source development and community governance 4. <strong>Integration depth</strong>: Protocols like Jupiter function as infrastructure rather than competitors, creating a more integrated ecosystem 5. <strong>Consumer app flywheel</strong>: The success of platforms like Pump.fun and meme coin trading drove retail engagement that flows into DeFi participation  <p>  <h3>Key Takeaways  <p>  - Solana DeFi grew from essentially $0 in early 2021 to over $10 billion by November 2021, driven by technical advantages and bull market momentum - The FTX collapse in November 2022 caused TVL to plummet 96%+ to approximately $210-364 million, but the ecosystem survived - Jupiter emerged as the critical infrastructure aggregating fragmented liquidity and processing $4 billion in volume during the post-FTX recovery - Liquid staking through Marinade Finance created the "stake-and-earn" model that expanded effective capital in the ecosystem - The lending and perps era (2023-2025) saw Kamino become the dominant lending protocol with $3.5B+ TVL, while Drift led perps volume - Six Solana protocols now exceed $1 billion in TVL, with total ecosystem TVL approaching $11 billion - Solana DeFi's differentiation from Ethereum stems from sub-second finality, sub-cent fees, integrated infrastructure, and a post-FTX culture emphasizing community ownership  <p>  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions  <p>  <strong>Q: What is total value locked (TVL) in DeFi?</strong> A: Total value locked (TVL) measures the total market value of crypto assets deposited into a DeFi protocol. It's calculated by summing the value of all collateral, liquidity, and staked assets. TVL serves as the primary metric for measuring DeFi ecosystem health and user adoption.  <p>  <strong>Q: How did Solana DeFi survive the FTX collapse?</strong> A: Several factors enabled survival: (1) The underlying blockchain continued functioning despite the collapse of associated entities; (2) Protocols like Jupiter, Raydium, and Orca weren't directly tied to FTX; (3) Developers quickly forked Serum to remove Alameda control; (4) The community rallied around building independent infrastructure; (5) Solana's technical advantages remained attractive to users and builders.  <p>  <strong>Q: What is the difference between Serum and Jupiter?</strong> A: Serum was an on-chain order book DEX created by Sam Bankman-Fried that became heavily connected to FTX/Alameda. Jupiter is a DEX aggregator that finds best prices across multiple DEXs. After FTX collapsed, Jupiter effectively replaced Serum as the primary trading infrastructure while Serum became effectively defunct.  <p>  <strong>Q: What makes Solana DeFi different from Ethereum DeFi?</strong> A: Solana's sub-second finality and sub-cent transaction fees enable fundamentally different use cases: high-frequency trading strategies, small-scale transactions viable for retail, and complex liquidations. Ethereum's higher costs and slower finality pushed users toward Layer 2 solutions, while Solana's design philosophy embraced chain-native DeFi.  <p>  <strong>Q: What is liquid staking?</strong> A: Liquid staking is a mechanism that allows users to stake their crypto assets (like SOL) while receiving a liquid token (like mSOL or JitoSOL) that can be used in DeFi. Users earn staking rewards plus additional yields from DeFi activities, significantly improving capital efficiency compared to traditional staking.  <p>  <h3>Sources  <p>  - [1] DefiLlama - Solana TVL Data (https://defillama.com/chain/Solana) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [2] Solana Foundation - "FTX Chooses Solana for Serum" (https://solana.com/news/ftx-chooses-solana-for-serum) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [3] Business Insider - "How Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX Impacted Solana Blockchain" (https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-solana-blockchain-crypto-sol-damage-reputation-2023-1) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [4] CoinDesk - "FTX Hack Sparks Revolution at Serum DEX" (https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/12/ftx-hack-spooks-solana-defi-community-igniting-revolution-at-alameda-controlled-serum-dex) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [5] Wired - "The Race To Save Sam Bankman-Fried's Other Crypto Exchange" (https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-serum-crypto-exchange/) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [6] GitHub - Awesome Decentralized Finance (https://github.com/ong/awesome-decentralized-finance) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [7] theMac's Substack - "Top DeFi Protocols Solana" (https://lemacc.substack.com/p/top-defi-protocols-solana) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [8] Marinade Finance Documentation (https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-protocol/faq) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [9] Earnpark - "Solana DeFi: Fast Chains, Real Yield, Smart Strategies" (https://earnpark.com/en/posts/solana-defi-fast-chains-real-yield-smart-strategies/) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [10] DailyCoin - "Solana's DeFi Ecosystem Hits New Yearly High with $655M TVL" (https://dailycoin.com/solanas-defi-ecosystem-hits-new-yearly-high-with-655m-tvl/) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [11] Bitget - "Solana's Crisis of Faith" (https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605026643) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [12] SolanaFloor - "Jupiter Records $4 Billion Trading Volume Following FTX Collapse" (https://solanafloor.com/news/jupiter-dex-aggregator-records-4-billion-trading-volume-in-wake-of-ftx-collapse) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [13] MEXC News - "Solana's lending markets enter a new era" (https://www.mexc.com/en-PH/news/259683) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [14] Kamino Finance (https://kamino.com/) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [15] MEXC News - "Solana's lending markets enter a new era" (https://www.mexc.co/news/259683) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [16] SolanaFloor - "Inside Solana's Record Year" (https://solanafloor.com/news/inside-solana-s-record-year-unpacking-the-milestones-behind-de-fi-s-growth-in-2024) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [17] CoinDesk - "Chaos at MarginFi Shakes up Solana DeFi's Borrow-and-Lend Landscape" (https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/04/11/chaos-at-marginfi-shakes-up-solana-defis-borrow-and-lend-landscape) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [18] CryptoSlate - "Solana DeFi TVL nears all-time high at $11.7B" (https://cryptoslate.com/solana-tvl-nears-all-time-high-at-11-7b-but-daily-fees-remain-stuck-under-2-million/) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [19] Crypto.news - "6 Solana protocols crossed $1B TVL" (https://crypto.news/6-solana-protocols-crossed-1b-tvl/) - accessed 2026-02-20 - [20] Syndica Blog - "Deep Dive: Solana DeFi - October 2024" (https://blog.syndica.io/deep-dive-solana-defi-october-2024/) - accessed 2026-02-20 </div>
