  <time class="date" datetime="2026-02-20">Published: 2026-02-20</time>
  <div class="article-content">--- created: 2026-02-20 09:35 UTC from: Quill tags:   - quill   - validator-com   - solana   - nft   - history status: final note: The 2021 Solana NFT boom — validator.com article — RETROFITTED ---  <p>  <h2>The 2021 Solana NFT Boom: How It Happened and Why It Mattered  <p>  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> In summer 2021, [Solana's](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) low fees and fast transactions catalyzed an NFT explosion, anchored by [Degenerate Ape Academy](https://dev.degenape.academy/) and fueled by [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io), creating a vibrant alternative to Ethereum's expensive minting landscape—before network congestion and market corrections forced hard lessons.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Introduction  <p>  In August 2021, the cryptocurrency world witnessed an unexpected shift. Ethereum's NFT ecosystem was exploding—CryptoPunks sold for millions, Bored Ape Yacht Club had just launched—but minting costs had soared to $50–$100 per transaction. Enter [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is): a high-performance blockchain promising sub-cent fees and near-instant confirmation.  <p>  Within months, Solana went from an Ethereum alternative to the epicenter of a new NFT culture. This is the story of how it happened, what was built, and why it still matters for validators, developers, and the broader Web3 ecosystem.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Why Solana Became the NFT Alternative to Ethereum  <p>  [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) launched in 2020 with a bold promise: deliver blockchain performance rivaling traditional financial systems without sacrificing decentralization. Its architecture—combining [Proof of History (PoH)](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) with [Proof of Stake (PoS)](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is)—theoretically supports 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum's 15–30 TPS at the time.  <p>  For NFTs, the practical advantages were immediate:  <p>  | Feature | Ethereum (2021) | Solana (2021) | |---------|-----------------|---------------| | Average mint cost | $30–$150+ | < $0.01 | | Transaction speed | 15–30 TPS | 3,000–6,000 TPS real-world | | Block time | 12–14 seconds | ~400 milliseconds |  <p>  Ethereum's "gas wars" became notorious. Popular mints could cost hundreds of dollars in fees, pricing out casual collectors and favoring those with deep pockets. [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) offered something radical: accessible minting for everyone.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Degenerate Ape Academy: The Collection That Started It All  <p>  On August 14, 2021, <strong>[Degenerate Ape Academy](https://dev.degenape.academy/)</strong> (DAA) minted all 10,000 of its cartoonish, exaggerated apes at 6 SOL each—approximately $40 at the time. The collection sold out in 8 minutes.  <p>  What made [Degenerate Apes](https://dev.degenape.academy/) transformative wasn't just the art—it was the community infrastructure. The project introduced a holder-only Discord, a concept that became standard for Solana NFT drops. Within weeks, the floor price exploded.  <p>  By September 2021, <strong>Degen Ape #7225</strong> sold for 5,980 SOL (approximately $1.1 million at the time), becoming the first [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) to break the million-dollar barrier. Other apes sold for $1.3 million and $1.7 million. The message was clear: [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) collections could command valuations comparable to Ethereum's blue chips.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Magic Eden's Rise to Dominance  <p>  Before [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io), Solana's NFT marketplaces included <strong>Solanart</strong> (launched in 2021) and <strong>DigitalEyes</strong>. But [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io), founded in 2021 by four friends, quickly dominated.  <p>  [Magic Eden's](https://magiceden.io) success rested on three pillars:  <p>  1. <strong>Fast, low-cost transactions</strong> — leveraging Solana's infrastructure 2. <strong>User-friendly interface</strong> — intuitive enough for newcomers 3. <strong>Creator-friendly terms</strong> — 2% marketplace fee vs. OpenSea's 2.5%  <p>  By late 2021, [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io) controlled over 90% of Solana NFT trading volume. It reached "unicorn" status (>$1B valuation) within nine months of launch, a testament to how quickly the [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) market had scaled.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Key Collections: The Solana NFT Renaissance  <p>  The [Degenerate Ape](https://dev.degenape.academy/) launch catalyzed a cascade of major collections:  <p>  <h4>SolPunks Solana's answer to CryptoPunks. 10,000 pixel-art characters launched in August 2021, becoming one of the earliest and most traded collections on the network.  <p>  <h4>Aurory A fantasy-themed RPG NFT collection combining gaming utility with collectible art. Aurory built one of the most engaged communities in the Solana ecosystem.  <p>  <h4>Star Atlas A play-to-earn space exploration game built on Solana. Its NFT collections represented in-game assets (ships, crew, territory), merging NFT speculation with gaming.  <p>  <h4>Okay Bears Launched in April 2022 but carrying the momentum from 2021's boom, Okay Bears became one of the largest [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) collections by volume and community size.  <p>  <h4>DeGods and y00ts Later collections that pushed the ecosystem forward, demonstrating that [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) could sustain multiple thriving NFT projects simultaneously.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>The Cultural Moment: Community, Discord, and Twitter Flipping  <p>  The 2021 [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) boom was more than a market event—it was a cultural movement.  <p>  <strong>Discord servers became the gathering place.</strong> Projects like [Degenerate Ape Academy](https://dev.degenape.academy/) pioneered holder-only access, creating exclusive communities where early adopters shared alpha, collaborated on flips, and built genuine connections. This "Discord-first" culture differentiated [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) from Ethereum's more anonymous trading culture.  <p>  <strong>Twitter became a trading floor.</strong> Collections developed dedicated followings. Floor prices—the minimum price for any NFT in a collection—fluctuated wildly. "Flipping" (buying low, selling quickly for profit) became a dominant strategy. Influential accounts could move markets with single tweets.  <p>  The energy was palpable. For many, it felt like being early on something revolutionary.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Floor Prices, Trading Volumes, and Wallet Growth  <p>  The numbers from late 2021 tell the story:  <p>  - <strong>Trading volumes</strong> on [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) marketplaces reached hundreds of millions of dollars monthly - <strong>Wallet growth</strong> exploded as new users created Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack wallets to participate - <strong>Floor prices</strong> for top collections like [Degenerate Apes](https://dev.degenape.academy/) peaked at hundreds of SOL  <p>  At its peak, [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) processed over 10,000 TPS during major NFT mints, demonstrating the network could handle significant demand—though this would prove both a blessing and a curse.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>How NFT Demand Stressed the Solana Network  <p>  The explosive growth exposed vulnerabilities. [Solana's](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) early architecture lacked robust congestion-management mechanisms, including priority fees and local fee markets.  <p>  The <strong>[September 14, 2021 Grape IDO](https://medium.com/@nitin132/the-history-of-solana-security-incidents-a-comprehensive-analysis-8f217c6971e6)</strong> (Initial DEX Offering) marked the first major stress test. The sale overwhelmed the network, causing a memory overflow crash that halted block production for several hours. This wasn't an attack—it was organic demand exceeding the network's ability to gracefully handle it.  <p>  Throughout late 2021 and into 2022, NFT mint botting repeatedly congested [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is). The April 30, 2022 outage was the culmination of these stresses, forcing the [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) core team to implement urgent fixes.  <p>  The lesson was clear: high throughput requires sophisticated congestion management. The team responded with priority fees and improved fee markets, but these upgrades came only after significant growing pains.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>The Crash and Lessons Learned  <p>  The bull run that fueled the 2021 boom collapsed in 2022. SOL's price fell from its November 2021 high of ~$260 to below $20 by late 2022. NFT floor prices crashed 80–95% across collections.  <p>  But the crash taught valuable lessons:  <p>  1. <strong>Network infrastructure must scale with demand.</strong> The congestion issues prompted fundamental improvements to [Solana's](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) fee markets and congestion handling.  <p>  2. <strong>Community survives speculation.</strong> Many of the builders, validators, and developers who entered during the boom stayed to build the ecosystem's future.  <p>  3. <strong>Not every collection survives.</strong> The market corrected, weeding out projects with no utility or genuine community.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Legacy: What the Boom Built  <p>  Despite the volatility, the 2021 [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) boom left lasting infrastructure:  <p>  - <strong>[Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io)</strong> remains the dominant [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) marketplace, expanded to Ethereum and Polygon - <strong>Wallet ecosystems</strong> (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack) matured into comprehensive Web3 portals - <strong>Developer tooling</strong> improved dramatically, making it easier to build NFT projects on [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) - <strong>Validator infrastructure</strong> strengthened as the network invested in stability - <strong>Cross-chain bridges</strong> emerged, connecting [Solana's NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) ecosystem to Ethereum and other chains  <p>  More importantly, the boom demonstrated that blockchain can support mainstream-friendly, low-cost digital ownership—a thesis that continues to drive innovation today.  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Key Takeaways  <p>  - [Solana's](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) sub-cent fees and high throughput made it the practical alternative to Ethereum's expensive NFT minting in 2021 - [Degenerate Ape Academy](https://dev.degenape.academy/), launching August 2021, became the catalyst for [Solana's](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) NFT explosion and achieved the network's first million-dollar sale - [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io) captured >90% market share by late 2021 through fast transactions and creator-friendly fees - Collections like SolPunks, Aurory, Star Atlas, and Okay Bears built thriving communities despite market volatility - Network congestion during major mints exposed architectural weaknesses that required significant upgrades to fix - The 2022 crash eliminated speculative excess but left behind lasting infrastructure, experienced builders, and a more resilient ecosystem  <p>  ---  <p>  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions  <p>  <strong>Q: What was the first [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) collection to sell for $1 million?</strong> A: [Degenerate Ape](https://dev.degenape.academy/) #7225 sold for 5,980 SOL (approximately $1.1 million) in September 2021, making it the first [Solana NFT](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) to reach the million-dollar mark.  <p>  <strong>Q: Why did [Solana NFTs](https://www.webopedia.com/crypto/learn/solana-nft-collections/) become so popular in 2021?</strong> A: [Solana](https://crypto.com/en/coins-ai/solana/what-is) offered near-instant transaction confirmation and fees under $0.01, compared to Ethereum's $50–$150 gas fees during popular mints.
